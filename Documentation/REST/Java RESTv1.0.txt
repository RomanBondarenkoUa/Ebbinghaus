reqtype=wordById
If something is wrong in the proccessing of the message it will response with Successful:false
If provided ID that doesn`t exist->Successful:false
If database went DOWN the program will disconect from it so it will always return ->Successful:false
If everthing is ok->Successful:true
Example of request

--------------------------

METHOD parametrizedWordTranslation

requestBy:ID/ENword/RUword(ID AND RUword is only available for database for now)
includeWordAudio:true/false
wordAudio:"US"/"GB"/"BOTH"
synonyms:true/false
sentencesENRU:true/false
There are all types of key:value pairs that can be inputed into request.
includeWordAudio flag must be true if you want to receive any wordAudio with accent that you need to provide.
If audio for accent will not be found ->no wordAudioGB/US keys wil be sended(be aware of that)
If you set an option wordAudio to "BOTH" and the program will not found one of the accent it will send all what it found.(for example if you want BOTH accents but only US was found you will get NO key for GB accent and 1 key with US(if it was found)
If you have missed one of the keys for request(With correct key)->Successful:false
With incorrect key->409 error
If you provided wrong key(irrespectively of values of another keys)->409 error
If you provided wrong value for key wordAudio->no wordAudioGB/US keys will be sended
If no audio for that accent:no wordAudioGB/US keys wil be sended
If you will search by using RUword and there is nothing that will satisfy this criteria in the database->Successful:false(because parser is not configured for searching Russian words yet)

Example of Request:
http://tempjavadictapp.herokuapp.com/dictionary?word=apple&key=754&synonyms=true&sentencesENRU=true&includeWordAudio=true&wordAudio=US&requestBy=ENword&reqtype=parametrizedWordTranslation
